# Define all the vowels, both lowercase and uppercase
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"

# Define the string to be analyzed for vowel count
string = "Hello, World!"

# Initialize a variable to store the vowel count, starting at 0
vowel_count = 0

# Iterate through each character in the string using a for loop
for char in string:
    # Check if the current character is in the list of vowels
    if char in vowels:
        # If it is a vowel, increment the vowel_count by 1
        vowel_count += 1

# Print the final vowel count
# The f-string allows embedding the variable values directly in the string
print(f"The number of vowels in the string '{string}' is: {vowel_count}")

# Detailed Explanation:
# 1. We define a string 'vowels' that contains all the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in both
#    lowercase and uppercase. This will be used to check against each character in the input string.
# 2. We define the string variable 'string' that holds the sentence we want to analyze. In this case,
#    the string is "Hello, World!".
# 3. We initialize 'vowel_count' to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of vowels found in
#    the string as we iterate through it.
# 4. We use a for loop to go through each character in the 'string' one by one.
# 5. Inside the for loop, we use an if statement to check if the current character (char) is found in the
#    'vowels' string. The 'in' operator checks for membership, returning True if the character is a vowel.
# 6. If the character is a vowel, we increase the 'vowel_count' by 1 using the += operator.
# 7. After the loop has processed all characters in the string, we print the result using an f-string to
#    format the output message, displaying the original string and the total number of vowels it contains.

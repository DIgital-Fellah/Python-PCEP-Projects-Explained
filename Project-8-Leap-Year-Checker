# Detailed explanation of each part:
# 1. Define a function named is_leap_year that takes one argument, year.
# 2. Inside the function, check if the year is divisible by 4 using the modulus operator (%).
# 3. If the year is divisible by 4, check the next condition: whether the year is divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
# 4. If the year meets both these conditions (divisible by 100 and not by 400), it is not a leap year.
# 5. Otherwise, if the year is divisible by 4 and either not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
# 6. If the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.
# 7. Outside the function, prompt the user to enter a year.
# 8. Convert the user's input from a string to an integer.
# 9. Call the is_leap_year function with the user's input and check if the year is a leap year.
# 10. Print the appropriate message based on whether the year is a leap year or not.

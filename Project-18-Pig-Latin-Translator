"""
Explanation of Pig Latin rules:
1. If a word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add "way" to the end of the word.
   For example, "apple" becomes "appleway".
2. If a word starts with a consonant, move all consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and add "ay".
   For example, "banana" becomes "ananabay".
3. If a word has no vowels, just add "ay" to the end of the word.
   For example, "rhythm" becomes "rhythmay".
